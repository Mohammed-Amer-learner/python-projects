# 📂 File Lister – Python Script

A simple Python script that lists all files inside given folders and handles common errors like missing folders or permission issues.

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. Define the folder paths in the script:
```python
folder_paths = ["path/to/folder1", "path/to/folder2"]

2. Run the script from the command line:
       python file_lister.py

📤 Output:
    ✅ Lists the files found in each folder.
    ⚠️ Prints an error message if a folder does not exist or cannot be accessed.

🧯 Error Handling:
    * FileNotFoundError: The folder path does not exist.
    * PermissionError: Access to the folder is denied.
    
💡 Example Usage:
If your folders are:
folder_paths = ["C:/Users/YourName/Documents", "/home/user/downloads"]

Running the script will print the files inside each folder or appropriate error messages.
📄 Requirements:
    Python 3.x
    No external libraries required
