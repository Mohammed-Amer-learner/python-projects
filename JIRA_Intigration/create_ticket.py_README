# Jira Issue Creator

This Python script creates a new issue in your Jira project using the Jira Cloud REST API.

## 📋 Features

* Authenticates with Jira using email and API token
* Creates a Jira issue with a structured description
* Sends a POST request to the Jira issue endpoint

## 🔧 Requirements

* Python 3.x
* `requests` library

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install requests
```

## ⚙️ Setup

### 1. Replace the API token

In the script:

```python
API_TOKEN = "Enter Api key here"
```

Replace it with your actual Jira API token.

You can generate one at: [https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)

### 2. Adjust issue data

Edit the following fields in the payload as needed:

```python
"project": {
  "key": "MFP"  # Change to your actual project key
},
"issuetype": {
  "id": "10001"  # Change to the correct issue type ID
},
"description": {
  ...
}
```

To get the correct `issuetype` ID, you can query `/rest/api/3/issuetype` or use the Jira UI.

## 🚀 Running the Script

```bash
python create_jira_issue.py
```

## 🖨️ Example Output

```json
{
  "id": "10001",
  "key": "MFP-1",
  "self": "https://mohammedamer.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/10001"
}
```

## 🛡️ Security Tips

* Do **not** commit your API token to Git or share it.
* Consider storing sensitive data in environment variables or using a `.env` file with the `python-dotenv` package.
